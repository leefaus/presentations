  # Technical Authorization Overview
  <br>
  ### Technical Authorization Goal:
  <br>
  Ensure Channel Partners are proficient at delivering the following services for GitHub customers to drive adoption and customer success:
    - GitHub Enterprise Installation and Setup
    - End User Administration Concepts
    - Migrating to GitHub Enterprise
    - Integrations: Webhooks, API's
    - Advanced GitHub Administration
  <br>

  GitHub requires that each SI and ASP partner have a minimum of 2 (two) Authorized consultants.  Authorization will occur through a GitHub led enablement session consisting of educational material and labs as well as 1 (one) or more customer engagements that include GitHub Services as shadow resources to verify and authorize the required skills from the partner consultants.

  # Partner Authorization Engagement(s)
  <br>
  Upon completion of the on-site technical enablement session, partner resources are required to complete at least one customer engagement with shadow resources from GitHub services to demonstrate their competency in the required skills.  These engagements may be partner or GitHub sourced.

  ### Notes:
  <br>

  - 1st shadow engagement should occur withing 45 days of completion of the on-site enablement session.
  - Services shadow rate for partner enablement is 50% of standard daily rate in the region.
  - Shadow resources *will not* be an option for every customer engagement given budget constraints.
  - We anticipate partner consultants will require 1 - 3 shadow engagements to be authorized.
